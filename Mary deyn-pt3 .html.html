<h1 style="color:Green">My dear parents</h1>
<p style="color:Teal"> Mama and Papa, you two are amazing, you are the pillars of my life, you are the testament of unwavering dedication and selfless love. Your hard work and unwavering commitment of providing the best for me and toto have shaped me into the person I am today. Mama, you are a whirlwind of energy, a tireless force of nature that always juggles work. You are not only a nurturing parent but also my first and most influential teacher, you are the one who taught me about life, the good, the bad, and the ugly. You did not sugarcoat your words of making me and toto understand how hard life is and that there is no shortcuts, you showed us how to navigate through those tough situations often helping us through it or sometimes even taking matters into your own hands, you are truly inspiring and I am happy and thankful that you shaped my character and prepared me we for the challenges ahead I would not have made it this far without you.<br> <br> </p><p style="color:Green"> Papa you are a different story but equally important in my life. For me you are the happy energetic and compassionate strength in the family. While work often takes you away from home your absence is filled with the knowledge of your tireless efforts to secure the family's well-being and your video calls and texts always makes me feel like you are here at home, seeing you work so tirelessly for us has instilled a burning desire in me to do my best and strive harder to make your dreams come true of someday becoming rich. Your dedication is a constant reminder of the sacrifices of parents make to create a stable and loving environment for their children.<br> <br> </p><p style="color:Teal"> Growing up with the two of you is incredible and your combined efforts has created a home filled with love support and a strong sense of family. You have shown me the importance of family, the true meaning of hard work and the power of unconditional love. Your sacrifices though often unseen have shaped me into a better person. The two of you are honestly not just my parents but you are also my mentors, role models, and the foundation upon which I build my future. You two are my constant reminder and source of inspiration motivating me to strive for excellence and live a life worthy of your sacrifices. <br> <br> </p><h2 style="color:Green">Sincerely yours, Yenyen..</h2> <p></p>
